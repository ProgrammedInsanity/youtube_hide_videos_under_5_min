# youtube_hide_videos_under_5_min

Simple user script to hide videos under 5 min. I have only written like 60 out of the 300 lines of code. So i don't take credit for anything except for what i have written. Most of the credit goes to [EvHaus](https://github.com/EvHaus/youtube-hide-watched) and those who contributed to the project.
